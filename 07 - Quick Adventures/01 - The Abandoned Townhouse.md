# The Abandoned Townhouse

{.homebrew}

This Quick Adventure is designed for a party of roughly three to five 5th level players.{.no-fancy}

## Adventure Background

In the Bluelake district of Neverwinter sits an abandoned townhouse. The home used to belong to the Cormyrean war wizard, Elden Vargas. Elden Vargas had dealings with the Ashmadai who ultimately exploited him and kidnapped his wife and committed her to Helm's Hold. In an attempt to rescue his wife from Helm's Hold, he used his substantial psychic magic to send many of Neverwinter's residents into madness. Soon after this attack, he left Neverwinter for Helm's Hold. Elden Vargas and his foul deeds were ultimately stopped at Helm's Hold (where heroic adventurers either captured or killed him), and Vargas never returned to his townhouse.

Before leaving, Elden Vargas used magic to seal shut his townhouse to prevent intruders from entering. This abandoned property has been long-desired by those looking to claim the abandoned estates of the Bluelake district, but the magical wards on the property have, so far, kept any squatters from taking the property.

The Dead Rats gang, who operates in the sewers of Neverwinter, has been eying the property for some time. They have recently enlisted one of their mages from Luskan to help break the magic wards on the property so they can claim whatever magical relics might lie within.

## Adventure Hooks

**Rumors of Riches**<br />
The adventurers overhear tavern talk about a strange, abandoned noble estate that has yet to be looted. The tavern patrons speculate there are rare magical items in the estate and anyone brave enough to enter the place would be richly rewarded.

**Commissioned**<br />
The adventurers are commissioned by a wealthy merchant to break down the magical barrier preventing entry into the house. The merchant would ultimately like to renovate and sell the estate, but can't do so until the magic barrier is removed.

## Investigating the Townhouse

When the players approach the house, read the following:

> An iron fence surrounds the townhouse, but the gate swings open freely. The wind begins unnaturally howling and the sky darkens slightly with cloud cover. The townhouse, other than having some untended plants taking over, appears to be in decent shape. The windows emit a faint blue glow but are otherwise too dusty to peer through. {.read}

### 1. Townhouse Exterior

|![Skull](../skull.svg)[Encounter: 2 x Wererat Assassin, 1 x Wererat Mage](abandoned-townhouse-wererat-encounter)|
{.enemy .screen-only}

The door to the townhouse is firmly locked. The entire house is protected with abjuration magic, and attempts to physically break through a window or door will be met with failure (no matter how strong the party members are). The magical barrier, placed by Elden Vargas, was meant to keep common thieves out of his home while he was away. A simple [Dispel Magic](/spell/dispel-magic) spell will rid the entire townhouse of the barrier.

As the players try to enter the door, however, three members of the Dead Rats gang (2 [Wererat Assassins](/monster/wererat-assassin){.screen-only}[Wererat Assassins](wererat-assassin-page){.print-only .monster} and a [Wererat Mage](/monster/wererat-mage){.screen-only}[Wererat Mage](wererat-mage-page){.print-only .monster}) approach from behind:

> As you work out how to enter the structure, three half-man-half-rat hybrids enter the gates behind you. Two are dressed in black leather and carry an array of swords and daggers, and one is in robes and carries a glowing staff. One of the leather-clad rats snarls at you, "this is Dead Rats property you're trespassing on, and we think it is best if you leave." {.read}

The party is free to leave unharmed if they wish. If they choose to do so, the next time they return to the property, it will be ransacked and empty of all items. If the adventurers decline to leave, the wererats attack. If the Wererat Assassins are killed first, the Wererat Mage will attempt to flee. The Wererat Mage can be coerced to dispel the magic barrier if captured alive.

### 2. Dining & Living Room

A strange blue flame flickers in the hearth but produces no heat. Old cobwebs line the walls, and dust has settled on every surface. A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check on the bookshelves will reveal a [1st Level Spell Scroll](/item/spell-scroll-1st-level){.magic-item}.

### 3. Kitchen

The same strange blue flame is in the kitchen hearth. Despite producing no heat, a pot of water boils away on the hearth. Despite bubbling away, however, the water is actually cold to the touch. All of the food in this area has long rotted away to dust. When a creature enters the bathing room attached to the kitchen, the tub magically fills with water and starts heating.

### 4. Study

The floor in the study has grown creaky and the upstairs furniture is coated in dust like all the other areas of the home. A potted plant has long since died and withered away. The door to Elden Vargas's bedroom (Section 5) gently bangs as if a window inside were left open. A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check on the bookshelves will reveal a [2nd Level Spell Scroll](/item/spell-scroll-2nd-level){.magic-item}.

### 5. Bedroom

{.enemy .screen-only}

Elden Vargas has left a [Storm Gyre](/monster/storm-gyre){.screen-only}[Storm Gyre](storm-gyre-page){.print-only .monster} in his bedroom to stand sentry. When the players open the door to the room, read:

> In the center of the room, a swirling vortex crackles with arcs of lightning. The vortex stays steady in the center of the room for a few heartbeats, but then a face emerges from the tempest. A chaotic wind sweeps through the room and sends papers on the desk flying. The vortex comes rushing at you. {.read}

The Storm Gyre attacks any creatures on sight and will fight until it is destroyed. It is not particularly smart, and will attack the nearest creature. However, if multiple creatures are close together, it will attempt to use its lightning attack to arc lightning through multiple creatures.

After defeating the Storm Gyre, players that search through the wardrobe in the bedroom will find a random item from [Magic Item Table B](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#MagicItemTableB) from the Dungeon Master's Guide. Pinned to a desk is a note that simply reads:

> My dearest Karis - If you're reading this, know that I'm truly sorry. - **Elden** {.paper}
